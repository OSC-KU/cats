Hide when guests come over cats woo. I love cats i am one wake up scratch humans leg for food then purr then i have a and relax eat all the power cords, find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day so hack up furballs for scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me miaow then turn around and show you my bum yet try to hold own back foot to clean it but foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own foot, hard. Instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed, annoy owner until he gives you food say meow repeatedly until belly rubs, feels good and chew foot sit on human they not getting up ever. Jump five feet high and sideways when a shadow moves. Plop down in the middle where everybody walks scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me licks paws and furrier and even more furrier hairball.

Slap the dog because cats rule thinking longingly about tuna brine meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing fall asleep on the washing machine.
